### 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── locales/
│   ├── middleware/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── consts.ts/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── .prettierrc
├── tailwind.config.cjs
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### ✍️ Admin dashboard

You can access the admin dashboard for editing blog post at `/admin` (https://example.com/admin)

Sveltia cms uses the same configuration as Decap cms, so you can follow the documentation at https://decapcms.org/docs.

In order to access the admin dashboard to change blog articles content you need to have access to the github repo, a quick way to test it test would be fork the repo and than configure sveltia cms accordingly to your cloud provider (netlify, cloudflare, vercel, etc...).

If you use cloudflare pages you can follow this guide https://github.com/i40west/netlify-cms-cloudflare-pages.

If you use netlify it's actually easier, you will need to change in the file `astro.config.mjs` NetlifyCMS config `config.backend.name` to git-gateway. (See https://decapcms.org/docs/git-gateway-backend/#git-gateway-with-netlify for more info)
